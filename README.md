# Minimal Hapi + React + Webpack + HMR Sandbox

Hey there. This starter kit connects a hapi.js server with webpack dev server with hot module reloading all set up.

Basic production config is also in place.

This is a work in progress. Documentation is @TODO. Check out npm scripts, config files and comments for now.
